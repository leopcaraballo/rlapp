### 2026-02-24 — Pulir frontend: validación y estilos

- Actor: AI assistant (Copilot)
- Task: Añadir validación a formularios `reception`, `cashier`, `medical`; estilos responsivos; tests básicos; build y despliegue frontend.
- Files changed:
  - rlapp-frontend/src/app/reception/page.tsx (form migrated to react-hook-form + zod)
  - rlapp-frontend/src/app/cashier/page.tsx (form migrated to react-hook-form + zod)
  - rlapp-frontend/src/app/medical/page.tsx (form migrated to react-hook-form + zod)
  - rlapp-frontend/src/app/*/page.module.css (new CSS modules for responsive layout)
  - rlapp-frontend/src/infrastructure/adapters/SignalRAdapter.ts (added compatibility alias)
  - rlapp-frontend/src/infrastructure/adapters/SocketIoAdapter.ts (added compatibility alias)
  - rlapp-frontend/src/domain/ports/RealTimePort.ts (added optional alias method)
  - test/app/{reception,cashier,medical}.spec.tsx (basic rendering tests)

- Actions performed:
  1. Audited reception/cashier/medical pages and implemented typed validation using `react-hook-form` + `zod`.
  2. Added basic responsive CSS modules and wired them into pages.
  3. Installed dependencies (`react-hook-form`, `zod`, `@hookform/resolvers`) using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.
  4. Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues by adding backwards-compatible aliases for real-time adapters; `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
  5. Added minimal unit tests for the three pages and adjusted test mocks for `next/navigation`.
  6. Built and started `frontend` container via `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d frontend`; validated `/test` route responds 200.

- Notes / Human checks:
  - TODO: show user-facing error messages for API failures (left as `// TODO` in handlers).
  - Server-side SignalR group emits are recommended to provide real-time updates without polling.
  - Prefer to run full test suite and E2E tests in CI where backend services are available to avoid network-related flaky tests.
